# ISObash
A prototype of a isometric engine made in Bash.

Now: 0.1 version

I love the old isometric 8 bit games: Knight Lore (1984), Batman (1986), Head Over Heels (1987)... 
I decided as a challenge to create an basic ASCII graphics engine in BASH language. Run on any Linux terminal.

Who is interested can use my code to continue it. The only requirement of MIT license is to mention the source and me as the creator :)

How to play?

1.     Download ISObash.sh
3.     Open any Linux terminal from computer (tty or pty) or Android phone (Termux) and go to the path where you downloaded the file.
4.     bash ISObash.sh
